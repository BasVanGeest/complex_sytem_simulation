# GenAI Usage Report – Final Project

## Overview of GenAI Usage

GenAI tools were used throughout the project as **technical support** to improve efficiency, debugging, code organization, and documentation. All core modeling decisions, extensions, and analytical choices were developed independently. GenAI was not used to replace reasoning or design, but to assist with implementation details and error resolution.

**GenAI tools used:**

-   ChatGPT (OpenAI)
    
-   GitHub Copilot (via UvA)
    

No other GenAI tools were used.

## What GenAI Was Used For Specifically

### Baseline Model

For the baseline implementation, GenAI was used for:

-   Debugging minor logical and runtime errors after an initial working version was completed
    
-   Improving code readability and robustness
    
-   Assisting with directory structure corrections
    
-   Helping implement CSV output in the `run_baseline` script, including how to create the file and specify where it is saved
    
-   Supporting documentation improvements such as docstrings and comments
    

The baseline model design and implementation itself were developed independently.

----------

### First Extension

For the first extension, GenAI was used primarily at the execution and analysis level:

-   Debugging extension-specific runtime issues
    
-   Assisting with reading CSV files for analysis
    
-   Helping save plots generated by the plotting scripts
    
-   Improving overall code organization and consistency across modules
    

All extension logic and analytical decisions were made independently.

----------

### Second Extension

For the second extension, GenAI was used for both debugging and structural support:

-   In the heterogeneity extension, the core idea of randomly drawing agent-specific alpha values from a normal distribution at the start of the simulation was implemented independently
    
-   GenAI was then used to improve the organization and structure of the heterogeneity class and to debug execution issues
    
-   Assisting with the `run_heterogeneity` and `run_networks` scripts, particularly for:
    
    -   Creating and saving CSV output files
        
    -   Ensuring compatibility between simulation output and plotting scripts
        
-   Supporting plotting utilities, specifically how to open CSV files and how to save generated plots to disk

## Reflection

GenAI was used as a **supporting tool** to facilitate debugging, code organization, file handling, plotting, and documentation. All adopted suggestions were critically evaluated and integrated only when fully understood. Core model design, extensions, experimental setup, and interpretation of results were developed independently, in full alignment with the course’s GenAI usage guidelines
