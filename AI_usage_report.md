# GenAI Usage Report – Final Project

## Overview of GenAI Usage

GenAI tools were used as **technical support** during the project to assist with debugging, file handling, plotting, code organization, and clarification of theoretical details from the literature. GenAI was not used to design the model, define extensions, or interpret results. All modeling and analytical decisions were made independently, with GenAI serving only as a supporting tool.

----------

## GenAI Tools Used

-   **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** – debugging support, explanations, implementation guidance, and clarification of theoretical questions related to the reference papers
    
-   **GitHub Copilot (via UvA)** – inline code suggestions and docstring generation
    

No other GenAI tools were used.

----------

## Prompting Strategy

A **task-focused and explanatory prompting strategy** was followed. Prompts were formulated around concrete implementation or conceptual issues and emphasized understanding rather than solution generation. GenAI outputs were critically evaluated and adapted when necessary.

----------

## Use of GenAI by Project Component

### Baseline Model

GenAI was used for:

-   Debugging minor logical and runtime errors after an initial working version existed
    
-   Improving code readability and robustness
    
-   Assisting with CSV output implementation and directory handling
    
-   Supporting documentation improvements (docstrings and comments)
    

The baseline model logic and implementation were developed independently.

----------

### First Extension

GenAI was used for:

-   Debugging extension-specific runtime issues
    
-   Assisting with reading CSV files for analysis
    
-   Helping save generated plots to disk
    
-   Improving consistency and organization across modules
    

All extension logic and analytical decisions were made independently.

----------

### Second Extension

GenAI was used for:

-   Debugging execution issues in the heterogeneity extension
    
-   Improving class structure and overall code organization
    
-   Supporting CSV output compatibility between simulation and plotting scripts
    
-   Assisting with plotting utilities
    
-   Clarifying theoretical doubts related to the reference papers, such as interpretation of parameters, assumptions, and model behavior
    

The conceptual design of the extension (e.g., heterogeneous agent parameters) was implemented independently.

----------

## Examples of GenAI Usage

### Example 1 – CSV Output and Directory Handling

**Issue:**  
The project required running the simulation from the terminal, importing the model logic from a separate module, and saving the simulation output as a CSV file in a designated `data` folder. Ensuring correct file paths and directory handling caused initial issues.

**Example prompt to ChatGPT:**

`I want to be able to execute from the terminal a file that runs the model imported from  a bornholdt_model file and saves the results of the simulation as a CSV file in the data folder. How can I do that?` 

**GenAI output:**

-   Suggested separating execution logic into a run script
    
-   Explained how to correctly import the model module
    
-   Provided a short example showing how to create the data directory if it does not exist and write simulation output to a CSV file
    

**Adoption decision:**

-   The general approach was adopted
    
-   Directory-handling logic was used, but code was rewritten to match the project structure
    
-   Output format and naming conventions were defined independently
    

----------

### Example 2 – Reading CSV Files for Analysis

**Issue:**  
For analysis and plotting, CSV files stored in a `data` folder located in the main project directory needed to be read while working from scripts inside the `code` folder.

**Example prompt to ChatGPT:**

`How can I read a CSV file that is inside a data folder in the main directory, if I am working inside the code folder in the same main directory?` 

**GenAI output:**

-   Explained how relative paths work in Python
    
-   Suggested using paths such as `../data/filename.csv`
    
-   Mentioned best practices for keeping file paths consistent across scripts
    

**Adoption decision:**

-   The explanation of relative paths was adopted
    
-   The exact path structure was adjusted manually to fit the project layout
    
-   File-loading logic was kept minimal to preserve clarity
    

----------

## GenAI Outputs (Type and Size)

Across the project, GenAI produced:

-   **Short code snippets** (approximately 5–15 lines)
    
-   **Concise textual explanations** (1–2 paragraphs)
    

No full implementations, model logic, or analytical results were generated by GenAI.

----------

## Reflection

GenAI was most useful for resolving practical implementation issues and clarifying theoretical details from the literature. Its main limitation was that outputs were often generic and required adaptation to the specific project context. Overall, GenAI functioned as a **supporting technical assistant**, helping streamline development without replacing understanding or decision-making.
